# Dice.Roll

This was an assignment from mobile application development that had an individual project that followed step by step with a YouTube creator who has a playlist of multiple videos to guide students on how to build a dice roller via Android Studio. The YouTube link is https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsF3G8o7POZwo9bBmt8l9aFY9b94mJc6A.

I've followed everything it has demonstrated in the video. Six images in this project were downloaded from https://www.flaticon.com. The author of those six images is IconsNova, and you can find their artwork at https://www.flaticon.com/authors/iconsnova.

There were a few modifications made with the assistance of LLM. The modifications I've incorporated in this are listed below.

Changed the default background to a more pleasant and less eye-straining color.
Updated the color of the buttons that match the color of the dice as closely as possible.
Added a button that resets the count. There is a shaded grey text that displays the number of times the dice has been rolled. The reset button is to allow the user to reset the count to zero.
Shake animation - I added this feature because I thought it would kind of give the user a visual pleasure, as if they were shaking the dice. Comfort visual appearance.
